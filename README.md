# Antelope

Scripts, docs and CRs to help me while working on OpenStack Antelope
with OpenShift and Ceph.

- My [docs](docs) are not meant to take the place of
  https://github.com/openstack-k8s-operators/docs

- My [scripts](scripts) and [CRs](crs) are not meant to take the place
  of https://github.com/openstack-k8s-operators/install_yamls

Instead [docs](docs) has my notes on how to use
my [scripts](scripts) and [CRs](crs) to reproduce various
deployments quickly on my
[hypervisor](https://pcpartpicker.com/user/fultonj/saved/v9KLD3).
Some of my scripts are just shell wrappers for
[install_yamls](https://github.com/openstack-k8s-operators/install_yamls).

## Deployments

- [Standard](docs/standard.md)
- [External Ceph](docs/ceph.md)
- [HCI](docs/hci.md)
