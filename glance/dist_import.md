# Distributed Image Import

Glance supports an
[interoperable image import
process](https://docs.openstack.org/glance/latest/admin/interoperable-image-import.html)
via
[import_plugins](https://github.com/openstack-k8s-operators/glance-operator/tree/main/config/samples/import_plugins).

The image itself, output by this process, will be stored in one
storage backend (e.g. Ceph RBD) but the process requires its own
separate storage staging area which the glance-operator provides
via a PVC.

Use of the RWX
[access mode](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/#access-modes)
for the import PVC should be avoided because:

- Glance supports [distributed image import](https://opendev.org/openstack/glance/commit/41e1cecbe63c778ce8e92519993c61588ea1f0cb)
- The import will perform better by running on a non-shared filesystem
- Only a subset of popular PV backends support RWX access mode
- We want to fully support local-storage from OCP worker nodes and not
  require any type of special PV backend

[PR352](https://github.com/openstack-k8s-operators/glance-operator/pull/352)
moved the glance-operator to 
[StatefulSet](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/statefulset)
so that when a glance pod is scaled, it automatically gets a new PVC
which is bound to it.

## Testing

### Deployment

After [minimal.sh](minimal.sh) has run and there are 0 glance pods,
deploy Ceph.

```
pushd ~/install_yamls
make ceph
popd
```

Create a PVC to host a staging area.
```
oc create -f ~/glance-operator/config/samples/import_plugins/image_conversion/image_conversion_pvc.yaml
```

Deploy one Glance pair (internal/external) configured with a Ceph RBD
backend and distributed image import using the
[glance-ceph overlay](../crs/control_plane/overlay/glance-ceph).

```
pushd ~/antelope/crs/
kustomize build control_plane/overlay/glance-ceph > control.yaml
oc apply -f control.yaml
popd
```

todo: Scale Glance replicas to 3 and count PVCs

### Image Creation

todo: Import multiple qcow2 images and observe conversion to raw
