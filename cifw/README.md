# Using the ci-framework to test validated architectures

My goal is to deploy 
[va1](https://github.com/openstack-k8s-operators/architecture/tree/main/validated_arch_1)
using the
[ci-framework](https://github.com/openstack-k8s-operators/ci-framework).
on my RHEL9 hypervisor.

Follow the "On your own hardware"
[guide](https://ci-framework.readthedocs.io/en/latest/quickstart/04_non-virt.html)

I use the following so I can type less.

- [deploy.sh](deploy.sh)
- [clean.sh](clean.sh)

I have continue updating [my-env.yml](my-env.yml) until I'm happy with it.
