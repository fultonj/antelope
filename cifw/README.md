# Using the ci-framework to test validated architectures

My goal is to deploy 
[va1](https://github.com/openstack-k8s-operators/architecture/tree/main/validated_arch_1)
using the
[ci-framework](https://github.com/openstack-k8s-operators/ci-framework).

Follow the
[On your own hardware](https://ci-framework.readthedocs.io/en/latest/quickstart/04_non-virt.html)
doc.
